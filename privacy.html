  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Effective Date: August 29, 2025</p>

  <p>Indigo Apps Co ("we," "our," or "us") develops and publishes mobile applications, including <strong>GPS Camera</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our apps.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Used to stamp photos with latitude, longitude, altitude, and compass direction.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera & Storage Access:</strong> Needed to take and save photos.</li>
    <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> If you submit feedback through our Google Form, we may collect your email only if you explicitly agree to be contacted.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Non-personal information such as app version and device type may be collected to improve app performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide GPS stamping features (location, time, altitude, compass, sun & moon direction).</li>
    <li>Ensure photos include accurate metadata for travel, work, and record-keeping.</li>
    <li>Improve performance, troubleshoot errors, and enhance user experience.</li>
    <li>Respond to user feedback and support requests (only if permission is given).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Protection</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our apps may use trusted third-party services (e.g., Google APIs, analytics) that have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies as well.</p>

  <h2>5. Permissions & Choices</h2>
  <p>You can manage app permissions (such as location or storage access) directly from your device settings. Denying permissions may limit certain app features.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain collected information only for as long as necessary to provide our services and comply with legal obligations. Photos are stored locally on your device and not uploaded to our servers.</p>

  <h2>7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our apps are not directed toward children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of digital consent in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
